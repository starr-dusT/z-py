# z-py
> Gotta go fast! -Bowser

A zippy note taking implementation that fits my needs. Principles are:

    1. Should be pure python and only rely on standard libraries
    2. Loosly based on the excellent Denote package for Emacs
    3. CLI first with potential to integrate with (n)vim
    4. Primarily for Markdown files, but can name other files
    5. Notes viewable and editable with Obsidian

Notes:

    - z-py assumes you want to operate in the current folder where the command
      is run. Folders are indicated by creating a `.z` file.
